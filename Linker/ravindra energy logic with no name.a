;derived from ravindra energy1
;date: 22-09-2021
;reason: to change the welcome message to remove micron instruments
;
;derived from ravindra energy.c
;date: 21-06-2019
;reason: to add loading of rtc value  to eeprom on power up if rtc value is valid.
;
;
;derived from only tracker1.c
;date: 19 -06-2019
;reason: to add protection for corruption of data
;
;1. add backup for time and date if corrupt
;        if time is corrupt, reset time to last stored value, if last stored value is ff, then reset to 12:00
;        store time and date every 30mins. total writes /year =16000.
;2. add limits to start angle and end angle. if they are corrupt reset them to 55/125 degrees
;
;
;
;derived from tracker 3 phase.c
;to change the latitude and longitude to 26.5 and 73.8 degrees
;to change the start angle and end angle to 50 deg and 125 deg.
;
;derived from micron 20W.c
;reason: to create a only tracker software
;todo
;1. remove the battery charger and battery voltage related part
;2. remove the adc sensing of various voltages. retain onlty the accelerometer part
;
;
;
;DERIVED FROM LUBI ELECTRONIC.C
;TO CHANGE WELCOME MESSAGE TO MICRON INSTRUMENTS
;
;
;
;derived from tracker3.c
;reason: to change welcome message to lubi electronics.
;
;
;date : 17-11-2013
;derived from tracker2.c
;
;reason:
;1.low battery indication in normal mode. hysterisis to be provided for reconnection on 12.4V
;2. cutoff backlight on low battery status (errfl2)
;3. if adc_battery > 15V, cut charging , put message ("no battery connected");
;4. remove condition that if battery voltage < 5V, disconnect charging.
;5. increase current limits to 1.2A/1A
;6. overflow for OCR1A correction
;7. fast charging depending on battery voltage
;8. low battery/battery not connected sensing and algorithm.
;9. bug of sleep mode.
;10.MPPT changed to full charge PV >=battery + 2.0V
;
;
;
;
;
;date: 13 nov 2013
;derived from tracker1.c
;reason: to test in new hardware
;changes:
;OC1A - pin 19 of mega32 - pwm output
;OC1B = pin 18 of mega32 - shutdown for ir2104
;mux lines pc7 and pc5 interchanged to suit new hardware solar4-main
;rs232 to be re-introduced
;
;
;
;
;
;derived from solar14.c
;
;reason: to add algorithm for sleep mode between sunset + 30 min and sunrise - 30 min.
;derived from solar13.c
;reason: to make algorithm change to the mechanical error logic.
;checked once every 30 seconds. if angle has changed more than 2 degrees then continue else end panel movement
;
;
;
;date: 04-nov 2013
;reason: to make following changes as suggested by tata solar
;1.enter/exit of calibration mode for start/emd angle setting improved.**
;2.LED indication in case of error on charger side to be inhibited.    **
;3. timeout for mechanical error to be changed
;4. battery low indication in absence of PV to be indicated.           **
;5. output to relay to be inhibited in all conditions even in manual mode. **
;
;
;date: 23-9-13
;reason:
;done: setting of latitude/longitude and timezone for user
;result stored in riset,settm.
;
;todo: put value in regular calculation of target angle.
;remove existing table for sunrise/set.
;
;********
;
;
;date: 16-09-2013
;
;derived from solar4.c
;reason:to add latitude/longitude calculations.
;only for checking purpose
;
;
;
;
;
;date: 20 july 2013
;reason:
;to add logic to come out of the program mode after 29 seconds of inactivity of key pressed
;the variable used is program_timeout, function added is clear_default();
;
;date:5-7-13
;reason: to add RS232 control to the unit.
;if 'R' is received, send record count.
;if 'P' is received, send print command.
;if 's' is received , reset record count.
;
;
;date : 29-6-13
;derived from solar1.c
;reason:
;to add fixed parameters batteryvoltage = 12V and MPPT 17V
;and to monitor and control charging parameters
